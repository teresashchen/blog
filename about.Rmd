## About me  

I am a PhD candidate in Human Physiology at the University of Oregon. I joined the Motion Analysis Lab in 2015. As a physical therapist, I aim to develop a career in the direction of mobility impairment research with translational applications to patient care or exercise performance. My research interest, specifically, focuses on age-related declines in cognitive and physical functions and their contributions to gait imbalance and falls and, ultimately, leads to new rehabilitation interventions.
