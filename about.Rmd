### Hi, I am Teresa Chen!  

I am a PhD candidate in Human Physiology at the University of Oregon. I joined the Motion Analysis Lab in 2015. As a physical therapist, I aim to develop a career in the direction of mobility impairment research with translational applications to patient care or exercise performance. My current research, specifically, focuses on age-related declines in cognitive and physical functions and their contributions to gait imbalance and falls and, ultimately, to lead to new rehabilitation interventions.

My favorite sports is Olympic weight lifting, inspired by [her](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuo_Hsing-chun) and all the other weightlifters I had been working with. I also like running, travling and trying all kinds of #dataviz & #rstats.
